Difference between different symmetric and assymetric algorithms OK


Symmetric Algorithms
DES
3DES
BlowFish (now TwoFish)
AES

DES - 64 bits - OLD Obsolete
3DES - 64 bits - uses three keys - Requires HSM - Performance issues in SoftHSM
BlowFish - BruceSchnier - 64, but good in software too.  Replaced by 124 bits of TwoFish
AES - 124 bits POPULAR NOW - US Federal FIPS approved

Asymetric algorithms
RSA - 1 KB, 2KB, 3KB keys
DSA - 1 KB, 2KB, 3KB keys - US Federal approved - faster decryption than enc
ECC - 256 bytes - Used in mobiles, tablets - FIPS approved

Hash and MACs
Fixed length hash

MAC vs Hash
MAC has the identity of the key , but hash does not
MAC is one of the item in certificates
Hash does not use crypto algorithms . MAC uses crypto algorithms
Hash not useful for security. MAC useful for security
Hash useful for use cases such as check file integrity.

Popular Hash Functions are
MD5
SHA-1
SHA-2

Popular MAC algorithms are
UMAC
VMAC

Padding is used in block ciphers to make sure the blocks are 32, 64, 128 .....
PKCS#5 padding
Asymetric padding is used to randomize the output

Local Master Keys (LMK)
LMKs are not used for encrypting data, but are instead used to encrypt and decrypt other keys as these enter or
leave the HSM. LMKs are a set of 40 DES keys.

Zone Master Keys
To securely exchange information between two users using the DES encryption scheme, it is vital to securely
share a set of initial keys. This role is fulfilled by the Zone Master Keys. Unlike an LMK which does not leave
the HSM, ZMKs are intended to be shared between sites to create secure Zones. The ZMK is distributed
manually between the sites. The ZMK allow future (data encrypting) keys to be automatically shared between
sites by encrypting those future keys with the ZMK.

Key Check Value
Zone PIN Key - A Data encrypting key

HSM Commands

Generate and Export SSL Server Certificate Signing Request - SG (CSR is generated and sent to CA)
Import CSR - SI

EMV Certificates are in DER format

Security Server interface

encrypt
decrypt
certificate sign request
import key (from friend)
export key (reverse)
