What is Zookeeper ?

*Distributed applications require co-ordination
- Develop your own service (lots of work) or use robust pre-existing Zookeeper

*Distributed open source centralized co-ordination service for:
 - Maintaining configuration information
   - Example: Sharing config information across all nodes
 - Naming Service
   - Example: Find a machine across a cluster of 1000 nodes 
 - Providing distributed synchronization
  - Example : Locks, Barriers, Queues...
 - Providing group services
 - Example : Leader election and more
* Zookeeper is reliable, distributed and fast
