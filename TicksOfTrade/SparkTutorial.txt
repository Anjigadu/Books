Amazon Dataset
fashio.json, electronics.json, sports.json


RDD
The dataset is divided into partitions

cluster
trnasform through spark context

how many partitions does the RDD have ?
data.getNumPartitions()

difference between reduce vs groupByKey


DataFrame API
RDD vs DataFrame (Both are transformable)

DataFrame has schema (two types - inferring schema and assigning schema)
RDD does not have schema

Why DataFrame over RDD?

DataFrame knows the schema and hence is 5 times more performant than RDD.

User defined functions are not performant as spark. because user defined functions take the controld from spark to java/python/scala. whereas spark functions execute in the spark's environment.

clean data
enrich data


SQLContext

New stuff: data Source api
schema evolution - In paraquet, you can start from a basic schema and just adding new fields

Run SQL directls on the file
 In Paraquet files, run the ddql on the file itself as parquet has got structure
 
 Partiion discovery
  Table partitioning is used in systems like Hive
  Data is normally stored in different directories
  
Data Set API
 
 
 Complex anaysiss with minimal programming effort
