Stop hoping for completion of anything in Life
Not doing right now; you are not going to later

Don't get lost in tasks and duties - Pursue your purpose
Minimize tasks and duties - Maximize your PURPOSE

Be Willing to change everything in your life 
Developing yourself  = Immunity to change
Just Don't care of loss - You can get back everything and even more.

Hold to your deepest realization.
Don't ask what to do to others.

If you have all the money and all the time, what would you do ?
