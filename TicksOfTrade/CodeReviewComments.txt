Calculator is very generic


comments only if its a public API for javadoc
no need configuration


typesafeconfig


enum of FRUit
(with constructor of price)

no need of Item interface


Inflection Point - Sandro


easy to read, test

too complicated - inflection point

no public in interface


Logger.error("", e)

throw new EdfdfdException(e);


Excetion Handlung

sonar - need not be impotant

No need TechnicalFailureException, just use Exception


No @Ignore

TestCalculator is CalculatorShould

fail_instations_with_wrong_properties should be the method name
no need final

unit test template

catch excetion template (no need printstacktrace, use runtimeexception)

separate config and id 

Configuration should be separate
Calculator is too many responsiblities
Calulatot - load file, parse, generate cost, offer calculation - WRONG


static import


lambda in new lines

no comments for private methods
no examples in comments


getTotalCost - formatCostForCustomerPayment


FileSystem is all over in code - centralise as a infrastructure


force the person to deal with no item


Offer is good

too many features not required in the excercise
