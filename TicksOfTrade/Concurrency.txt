How to avoid deadlock ?
Avoid locks by using lock-free data structures (e.g. use a ConcurrentLinkedQueue instead of a synchronized ArrayList)
2.Always acquire the locks in the same order, e.g. assign a unique numerical value to each lock and acquire the locks with lower numerical value before acquiring the locks with higher numerical value
3.Release your locks after a timeout period (technically this doesn't prevent deadlocks, it just helps to resolve them after they've occurred)
